Q1a,When do you perform a DAA rather than an anterolateral or posterior approach?,"We prefer the DAA when early recovery, less pain, and muscle preservation are goals. It’s a good choice for younger, active patients or those wanting a quicker return to work or sports. It also has a lower dislocation rate, so it's helpful in patients with good bone and normal anatomy. For complex cases like severe deformity, previous surgery, or poor bone, some surgeons use anterolateral or posterior based on exposure and what they’re most comfortable with."
Q1b,When do you perform a DAA rather than an anterolateral or posterior approach?,"The Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) for total hip arthroplasty is chosen to provide faster recovery, less soft tissue damage, better early functional outcomes, accurate component positioning, and a lower dislocation rate compared to other approaches. DAA is often used when early mobilization and rapid rehabilitation are desired, for patients suitable for minimally invasive techniques, and when intraoperative fluoroscopy is beneficial for optimizing implant placement and leg length. However, DAA is relatively contraindicated in patients with severe acetabular bone loss, posterior column incompetence, pelvic discontinuity, or retained hardware inaccessible from the anterior. Surgeon experience and patient-specific factors such as obesity may also impact approach selection."
Q1c,When do you perform a DAA rather than an anterolateral or posterior approach?,"The Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) for hip replacement is often chosen for its muscle-sparing benefits, potentially leading to quicker recovery and less postoperative pain. It is particularly suitable for patients who are active and wish to return to their normal activities swiftly. DAA is also preferred for its lower risk of dislocation and better preservation of hip function. However, it requires specialized surgical expertise and equipment. Surgeons may opt for DAA when they have the necessary experience and when the patient's anatomy is favorable, such as in non-obese patients with no significant hip deformities. The choice of approach ultimately depends on the surgeon's expertise and the specific needs and conditions of the patient."
Q2a,Which imaging do we need for the surgical planning?,"For planning, we always get an AP pelvis to assess joint space, bone stock, and alignment. A lateral helps with femoral anatomy and anterior osteophytes. If there’s deformity or leg length concern, full-length standing films can help assess alignment."
Q2b,Which imaging do we need for the surgical planning?,"The essential imaging required for surgical planning in total hip replacement is standardized, weight-bearing plain radiographs (X-rays). Specifically, an anteroposterior (AP) pelvis view with both hips and a lateral view of the affected hip are recommended. The AP view should be obtained with legs internally rotated by 15–20° to accurately assess femoral geometry and offset. In certain cases with complex anatomy, additional radiographic views or a CT scan may be used for further assessment of bone defects, implant positioning, or to aid in 3D templating and surgical simulation."
Q2c,Which imaging do we need for the surgical planning?,"For surgical planning of a total hip replacement, preoperative imaging is crucial. Typically, a combination of X-rays and, in some cases, CT scans are used. X-rays provide essential views of the hip joint, including anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views, to assess the joint space, bone quality, and alignment. These images help in evaluating the extent of arthritis, deformities, or any previous surgeries. CT scans may be used for more detailed 3D visualization, especially in complex cases, to assess bone stock and plan for implant positioning. These imaging techniques ensure precise planning and optimal outcomes for the surgery."
Q3a,When and how do we need to adapt for differences in leg length?,"We plan for leg length using preop planning on AP pelvis X-rays. Intraoperatively, we adjust with the stem, neck, and head size. On a standard table, we can compare legs directly. On a traction table, we rely more on fluoroscopy. Always pay extra attention to patients with preexisting leg-length-discrepancy or pelvic tilt."
Q3b,When and how do we need to adapt for differences in leg length?,"Surgical techniques to address differences in leg length during total hip replacement should be adapted both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Preoperatively, thorough clinical and radiological assessment—including templating using standardized X-rays—helps identify limb length discrepancy (LLD) and plan implant selection, neck cut, and insertion depth. Intraoperatively, limb length is checked after hip stability is ensured with trial components. Multiple methods, such as measuring from fixed bony pelvic and femoral landmarks, using calipers, and comparing the limb position to the contralateral side, help intraoperative accuracy. Adjustments to femoral neck length, offset, and stem position can be made to restore limb length difference within 5 mm of the normal side, as greater discrepancies are poorly tolerated."
Q3c,When and how do we need to adapt for differences in leg length?,"In total hip replacement, addressing leg length discrepancies is crucial for patient comfort and function. Discrepancies can occur due to pre-existing conditions or surgical technique. During surgery, assess leg length by comparing the position of the knees and ankles with the patient in a supine position. Use intraoperative tools like a caliper or navigation systems for precise measurement. If a discrepancy is detected, adjust the femoral component's position or select a different implant size. Postoperatively, if a minor discrepancy persists, shoe lifts or physical therapy may help. Always aim for balance to prevent complications like limping or back pain."
Q4a,How do we secure the diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis?,"Patients usually have groin or anterior thigh pain, morning stiffness under 30 minutes, and pain with hip flexion or internal rotation. Exam shows limited ROM, especially internal rotation and abduction. We confirm with AP pelvis and frog-leg lateral X-rays, looking for joint space narrowing, osteophytes, sclerosis, and cysts"
Q4b,How do we secure the diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis?,"Accurate diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis involves obtaining a meticulous patient history and thorough physical examination to assess symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and loss of function. Clinical examination should look for gait abnormalities, loss of motion (especially external rotation), limb length discrepancy, and any fixed deformities. Standard imaging, primarily weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and lateral hip radiographs with the leg internally rotated by 15–20°, is essential to evaluate joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and bony changes characteristic of osteoarthritis. Advanced imaging like MRI or CT may be used for further assessment if needed."
Q4c,How do we secure the diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis?,"To secure a diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis, a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging is essential. Clinically, patients typically present with symptoms such as hip pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. A thorough physical examination can reveal tenderness, crepitus, and limited movement. Imaging, particularly X-rays, is crucial for confirming the diagnosis. X-rays can show characteristic changes like joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts. In some cases, MRI or CT scans may be used for further assessment, especially if the diagnosis is uncertain or if other hip pathologies are suspected. A comprehensive approach ensures accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning."
Q5a,How much offset do we need?,"We aim to restore the patient’s native offset to maintain hip stability, abductor function, and leg length. The preoperative plan gives us a target, and during surgery, we assess soft tissue tension and stability during trialing. Too little offset risks impingement or instability, and too much can cause trochanteric pain or over-tension."
Q5b,How much offset do we need?,"The offset in total hip replacement should be restored as close to normal as possible, ideally within 5 mm of the normal or opposite side. Inadequate restoration can lead to poor functional outcomes such as abnormal gait, pain, impingement, and instability. The goal is to avoid less than normal offset and to maintain or slightly increase offset when necessary for stability, but not excessively, as a high offset increases joint reaction force and can cause pain and rapid wear."
Q5c,How much offset do we need?,"In total hip replacement, the offset is crucial for restoring the natural biomechanics of the hip. The offset is the distance from the center of the femoral head to the axis of the femoral shaft. It varies based on individual anatomy and implant design. Typically, the goal is to match the patient's natural offset to ensure proper joint function, stability, and muscle tension. This can range from 30mm to 50mm, but precise measurement is essential. Surgeons often use preoperative planning tools and intraoperative assessments to determine the correct offset. Always refer to specific surgical protocols and implant guidelines for accurate measurements."
Q6a,What are the advantages and disadvantages of navigation and robotic-assisted THA?,"Navigation and robotics can improve accuracy in cup positioning, leg length, and offset restoration. They help especially in complex anatomy or when fluoroscopy is limited. Downsides are increased cost, setup time, and a learning curve. There's also not yet strong evidence that they improve long-term outcomes compared to manual THA."
Q6b,What are the advantages and disadvantages of navigation and robotic-assisted THA?,"Navigation and robotic-assisted THA improve the accuracy and reliability of implant positioning according to the surgical plan. They allow patient-specific planning, provide real-time intraoperative feedback, and can reduce dislocation risks and revision rates. However, disadvantages include a steep learning curve, increased operative time, higher costs, radiation exposure (for preoperative imaging with robotics), limited implant compatibility, risk of tracker-related issues, and potential intraoperative technical problems. Long-term outcome and cost-effectiveness data are still lacking."
Q6c,What are the advantages and disadvantages of navigation and robotic-assisted THA?,"Navigation and robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) offer several advantages. They enhance surgical precision, improving implant alignment and positioning, which can lead to better joint function and longevity. These technologies also allow for more consistent outcomes and can reduce the risk of human error. Additionally, they may facilitate minimally invasive approaches, potentially reducing recovery time. However, there are disadvantages. The technology can be costly, increasing the overall expense of the procedure. It requires specialized training and can extend the duration of surgery. There is also a risk of technical malfunctions. Furthermore, the benefits over traditional methods are still being evaluated, and not all patients may experience significantly better outcomes."
Q7a,What are the key considerations when choosing between a cemented and a cementless femoral component?,"It's important to consider bone quality, patient age, and activity level. In younger patients with good bone, we prefer cementless stems for biological fixation. In older patients or those with poor bone stock, a cemented stem may provide better immediate stability and lower fracture risk. Surgeon experience and implant design also play a role."
Q7b,What are the key considerations when choosing between a cemented and a cementless femoral component?,"Key considerations when choosing between cemented and cementless femoral components in total hip replacement include patient age, bone quality, proximal femoral anatomy, and activity level. Cemented stems are favored in elderly patients and those with osteoporotic or altered proximal femoral bone, offering better early pain relief, immediate stability, and cost-effectiveness. Cementless stems are preferred in younger, more active patients with good bone stock, allowing long-term biological fixation. Surgeon experience and the potential need for easier revision surgeries also influence the choice."
Q7c,What are the key considerations when choosing between a cemented and a cementless femoral component?,"When choosing between a cemented and a cementless femoral component for a total hip replacement, key considerations include patient age, bone quality, and activity level. Cemented components are often preferred for older patients or those with poor bone quality, as the cement provides immediate stability. Cementless components rely on bone growth for fixation, making them suitable for younger, more active patients with good bone quality. Additionally, the surgeon's experience and preference, as well as the patient's medical history and lifestyle, play crucial roles in the decision-making process. Each option has its own risks and benefits, which should be thoroughly discussed with the patient."
Q8a,What are the most critical elements of a preoperative plan to ensure accurate component positioning?,"We need good-quality AP pelvis and lateral hip X-rays. We use templating to assess cup size, inclination, and version, and to choose a stem that restores offset and leg length. Identify any pelvic tilt, femoral deformity, or high anteversion that could affect implant choice or positioning."
Q8b,What are the most critical elements of a preoperative plan to ensure accurate component positioning?,"The most critical elements of a preoperative plan for total hip replacement to ensure accurate component positioning include obtaining standardized weight-bearing radiographs (especially AP pelvis with legs internally rotated 15–20°), meticulous templating on these radiographs to determine implant size, alignment, and the level of cuts, and assessing patient-specific anatomy for implant selection. Preoperative planning should account for leg length, hip offset, and the center of rotation, using anatomical landmarks to guide intraoperative component placement and anticipate challenges such as deformity or bone quality issues."
Q8c,What are the most critical elements of a preoperative plan to ensure accurate component positioning?,"In a preoperative plan for total hip replacement, critical elements include thorough patient assessment, imaging, and templating. First, evaluate the patient's medical history, physical condition, and any anatomical abnormalities. Use imaging techniques like X-rays or CT scans to assess bone quality and joint alignment. Templating helps in selecting the appropriate size and type of prosthetic components, ensuring they fit the patient's anatomy. Consider leg length, offset, and center of rotation to restore natural biomechanics. Preoperative planning should also include a discussion of surgical approach and potential challenges. This comprehensive preparation minimizes complications and optimizes component positioning for successful outcomes."
Q9a,The patient has a significant fixed flexion deformity of the hip. How does this influence your surgical technique and component positioning?,"A fixed flexion deformity limits hip extension, so I’m careful with positioning to avoid lumbar strain or poor exposure. During the approach, I release anterior structures as needed to gain full extension. For cup placement, I ensure proper anteversion despite the contracture, and I avoid excessive posterior tilt. I check that the stem restores extension on the femoral side without over-tensioning soft tissues."
Q9b,The patient has a significant fixed flexion deformity of the hip. How does this influence your surgical technique and component positioning?,"A significant fixed flexion deformity of the hip makes anterior approach more difficult and risky, especially for femoral retraction in osteopenic bones, and complicates effective release of the posterior capsule and external rotators. Positioning may be adjusted by preferring the lateral position to accommodate existing flexion and to aid exposure. These challenges influence both surgical technique and careful component placement to address deformity and reduce the risk of complications."
Q9c,The patient has a significant fixed flexion deformity of the hip. How does this influence your surgical technique and component positioning?,"In a patient with significant fixed flexion deformity of the hip, surgical technique and component positioning require careful adjustments. During the procedure, ensure adequate exposure and soft tissue release to correct the deformity. Pay special attention to the acetabular component positioning; it may need to be placed with increased anteversion to accommodate the altered anatomy and ensure stability. The femoral component should be positioned to restore the leg length and offset, considering the pre-existing deformity. Intraoperative assessment of leg length and stability is crucial. Post-operatively, focus on rehabilitation to address any residual soft tissue tightness and improve range of motion."
Q10a,"How does a patient's bone quality, such as in osteoporosis, influence the choice of implants and fixation method?","In patients with poor bone quality like osteoporosis, I consider using a cemented stem for better immediate fixation and lower fracture risk. For the cup, I may use a larger or multi-hole design with screws to improve stability. I also handle the bone gently during reaming and broaching to avoid intraoperative fractures."
Q10b,"How does a patient's bone quality, such as in osteoporosis, influence the choice of implants and fixation method?","A patient's bone quality, especially in cases of osteoporosis, significantly influences implant and fixation choice in total hip replacement. Poor bone quality favors the use of cemented implants because cementless fixation requires good bone stock for proper implant integration. Cemented fixation provides immediate mechanical stability, making it preferable for elderly patients with thin or osteoporotic bone, while cementless fixation is reserved for younger patients with sufficient bone quality to allow for biological ingrowth."
Q10c,"How does a patient's bone quality, such as in osteoporosis, influence the choice of implants and fixation method?","In patients with poor bone quality, such as those with osteoporosis, the choice of implants and fixation methods is crucial. Osteoporotic bones are more fragile and less capable of supporting traditional press-fit implants. Therefore, cemented fixation is often preferred, as it provides immediate stability by anchoring the implant with bone cement. Additionally, implants with porous coatings or hydroxyapatite may be used to encourage bone ingrowth and improve long-term stability. Surgeons may also opt for larger or longer stems to distribute stress more evenly and reduce the risk of fractures. Overall, the goal is to ensure secure fixation and minimize the risk of complications."
Q11a,What are the most common infection causes in DAA?,"Most infections in DAA come from skin flora, mainly Staph aureus and Staph epidermidis. Risk factors include poor wound care, prolonged surgery, obesity, diabetes, and hematoma formation. The bikini incision may have a slightly higher risk if wound tension or hygiene is an issue."
Q11b,What are the most common infection causes in DAA?,Blank
Q11c,What are the most common infection causes in DAA?,"In the Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) for total hip replacement, infections can occur due to several factors. The most common causes include bacterial contamination during surgery, often from skin flora like Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Poor surgical technique or breaches in sterile protocol can increase this risk. Patient-related factors such as obesity, diabetes, or immunosuppression also elevate infection risk. Additionally, prolonged surgery time and hematoma formation can contribute to infection. Preventive measures include strict adherence to aseptic techniques, appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, and careful patient selection and preparation. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent complications."
Q12a,Which comorbidities do we have to watch out for?,"We watch out for diabetes, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, and poor nutrition. These increase the risk of infection, wound healing issues, and overall complications. Cardiac and pulmonary disease can also affect anesthesia and recovery, so we optimize those preop."
Q12b,Which comorbidities do we have to watch out for?,Balnk
Q12c,Which comorbidities do we have to watch out for?,"When preparing for a total hip replacement, it's crucial to consider several comorbidities that can impact the surgery and recovery. Key concerns include cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease, which can increase surgical risk. Diabetes is another critical factor, as it can affect wound healing and increase infection risk. Obesity can complicate the procedure and recovery, while respiratory conditions like COPD may affect anesthesia and postoperative recovery. Osteoporosis can impact bone quality, affecting implant stability. Additionally, renal impairment and liver disease can influence medication metabolism and clearance. Proper management and optimization of these conditions preoperatively are essential for a successful outcome."
Q13a,How is the cup size defined?,"Cup size is based on the patient’s native acetabular diameter, measured on preop X-rays during templating. Intraoperatively, we ream sequentially until we get good bleeding bone and a stable fit, then choose a cup 1-2 mm larger than the final reamer size for press-fit fixation."
Q13b,How is the cup size defined?,Blank
Q13c,How is the cup size defined?,"In total hip replacement, the cup size refers to the diameter of the acetabular component, which is the part of the implant that fits into the hip socket. It is typically measured in millimeters and is crucial for ensuring a proper fit and stability of the implant. The correct cup size is determined based on the patient's anatomy, including the size of the acetabulum and the overall hip joint structure. Surgeons use preoperative imaging, such as X-rays or CT scans, to assess the appropriate size. Proper sizing helps in achieving optimal joint function and longevity of the implant."
Q14a,How is the femoral stem size defined?,"Stem size is defined by templating the femur on preop X-rays to match the canal size and restore offset. Intraoperatively, we broach sequentially until we get a tight fit with good rotational stability. Final stem usually matches the last broach used."
Q14b,How is the femoral stem size defined?,Blank
Q14c,How is the femoral stem size defined?,"The femoral stem size in a total hip replacement is defined by several factors, including the patient's anatomy, bone quality, and the specific design of the implant. The size is typically determined using preoperative imaging, such as X-rays or CT scans, to assess the dimensions of the femoral canal. Surgeons use this information to select a stem that fits snugly within the canal, ensuring stability and proper load distribution. During surgery, trial components may be used to confirm the fit and alignment. The goal is to achieve a balance between providing adequate support and preserving as much bone as possible."
Q15a,What specific measurements are taken from a preoperative X-ray?,"We measure leg length, femoral offset, and the size and shape of the acetabulum and femoral canal. We also assess cup inclination and version, femoral neck-shaft angle, and any deformities or limb length discrepancies."

Relative contraindications include very muscular patients or those with limited anterior soft tissue exposure."
Q16b,What are the contraindications for a DAA?,Blank
Q16c,What are the contraindications for a DAA?,"The Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) for total hip replacement has specific contraindications. Patients with significant obesity may face challenges due to limited surgical exposure. Those with severe hip deformities or previous hip surgeries might not be ideal candidates, as these conditions can complicate the approach. Additionally, individuals with certain anatomical variations, like a narrow pelvis, may not be suitable for DAA. Patients with poor bone quality or severe osteoporosis might also be at higher risk for complications. It's crucial for surgeons to evaluate each patient's unique anatomy and medical history to determine the most appropriate surgical approach. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice."
Q17a,How is the patient positioned on the operating table for DAA?,"The patient is positioned supine on the operating table. The pelvis is level, and the operative leg is prepped to allow full mobility, especially extension, external rotation, and adduction. On a standard OR table, a stiff cushion can be placed under the pelvis for better exposure. On a traction table, the foot is secured in a boot, and the assistant controls leg movement. Proper cushioning is very important to prevent nerve injury."
Q17b,How is the patient positioned on the operating table for DAA?,Blank
Q17c,How is the patient positioned on the operating table for DAA?,"In the Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) for total hip replacement, the patient is typically positioned supine on the operating table. This position allows the surgeon to access the hip joint from the front, minimizing muscle disruption. The patient's legs are often placed in a neutral position, with the operative leg slightly extended and externally rotated to facilitate access to the hip joint. Special tables or supports may be used to stabilize the pelvis and allow for precise manipulation of the leg during the procedure. This positioning helps in reducing post-operative pain and promoting quicker recovery."
Q18a,What are the key anatomical landmarks to identify on a preoperative AP pelvis X-ray?,"Key anatomical landmarks on a preoperative AP pelvis X-ray include the anterior superior iliac spines, acetabular teardrops, acetabular roof, pubic symphysis, obturator foramen, sacroiliac joints, and femoral heads and necks. We also assess the lesser trochanters for rotation and use the inter-teardrop or inter-ischial line to evaluate leg length and pelvic symmetry."
Q18b,What are the key anatomical landmarks to identify on a preoperative AP pelvis X-ray?,Blank
Q18c,What are the key anatomical landmarks to identify on a preoperative AP pelvis X-ray?,"On a preoperative AP pelvis X-ray, key anatomical landmarks to identify include the acetabulum, which is the socket of the hip joint, and the femoral head, which fits into the acetabulum. The greater and lesser trochanters of the femur are also important for assessing femoral alignment and rotation. The iliac crests and the ischial tuberosities help in evaluating pelvic symmetry and tilt. The obturator foramen should be checked for symmetry, as asymmetry might indicate pelvic rotation. Additionally, the sacrum and pubic symphysis are crucial for assessing overall pelvic alignment. Identifying these landmarks helps in planning the surgical approach and ensuring proper implant positioning."
Q19a,How does a patient's age and athletic status influence the treatment plan?,"In younger, active patients, we focus on precise implant placement, muscle sparing, and early rehab to get them back to full activity. In older or less active patients, the goal is safe early mobilization, independence, and fall prevention."
Q19b,How does a patient's age and athletic status influence the treatment plan?,Blank
Q19c,How does a patient's age and athletic status influence the treatment plan?,"A patient's age and athletic status significantly influence the treatment plan for a total hip replacement. Younger, more athletic patients may require implants that can withstand higher activity levels and offer greater durability. Surgeons might opt for materials like ceramic or highly cross-linked polyethylene to reduce wear. Additionally, younger patients may benefit from minimally invasive techniques to promote quicker recovery and return to activity. Conversely, older patients or those with lower activity levels might prioritize pain relief and improved mobility over longevity of the implant. Their treatment plan may focus more on ensuring stability and reducing surgical risks. Overall, the approach is tailored to balance the patient's lifestyle needs with the longevity and functionality of the implant."
Q20a,Should patients shave before surgery?,"No, shaving increases the risk of skin microabrasions and surgical site infections. If hair removal is needed, it should be done in the OR with clippers just before the procedure."
Q20b,Should patients shave before surgery?,Blank
Q20c,Should patients shave before surgery?,"Patients should not shave the surgical area before a total hip replacement. Shaving can create tiny cuts or abrasions on the skin, increasing the risk of infection. Instead, the surgical team will handle any necessary hair removal using sterile techniques just before the procedure. If hair removal is needed, they may use clippers rather than razors to minimize skin irritation. It's important for patients to follow the pre-operative instructions provided by their healthcare team to ensure the best possible outcome and reduce the risk of complications. Always consult with your surgeon or healthcare provider for specific guidance."
